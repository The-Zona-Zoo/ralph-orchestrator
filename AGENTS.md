## Virtual environment
- Use the project `.venv` for running Python commands and tests.
- If it does not exist, create it with `uv venv` from the repo root.
- Activate it before running commands: `source .venv/bin/activate`.
- When done, exit the environment with `deactivate`.

## Specs
- Create all specs in <repo-root>/specs/
- **DO NOT implement any feature or component without an approved spec in ./specs first.**
- Work step-by-step: spec → review → implement.
- Do NOT add code examples to any specs
